## Major Problems Encountered
1. Issue 1: Implementing Matrix-Vector Multiplication
    - Problem: Implementing the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm posed difficulties, especially in managing dynamic memory allocation and     
      ensuring efficient traversal of matrices and vectors.
    - Solution:Breaking down the implementation process into smaller, manageable tasks. Utilizing pseudocode and algorithmic diagrams to plan the     
      implementation before coding. Paying close attention to memory management, ensuring proper allocation and deallocation of memory to avoid memory 
      leaks. Systematically debugging the code using print statements and debugging tools. 
    
2. Issue 2: Tiling Optimization 
    - Problem: Implementing tiling optimization techniques was challenging, requiring a deep understanding of data locality and memory access patterns.
    - Solution: Investing time in understanding the principles of tiling and its impact on performance. Experimenting with different tile sizes and 
      configurations to find the optimal solution. Utilizing profiling tools to analyze memory access patterns and identify bottlenecks. Collaborating 
      with peers and seeking guidance from instructors for effective tiling strategies.

3. Issue 3: Benchmarking
    - Problem: Developing robust benchmarking scripts and ensuring accurate timing measurements was daunting.
    - Solution: Designing benchmarking scripts with clear objectives and parameters. Ensuring consistency in testing conditions by running 
      benchmarks on the same hardware and under similar environmental settings. Implementing statistical analysis techniques to calculate average 
      execution times and identify outliers. Validating benchmark results through repeated testing and comparison with theoretical expectations.
